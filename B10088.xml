            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But how much ſecurer the Anwerpians were, ſo much the more cautious were <hi>Alexanders</hi> Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. There were preſent at the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, beſides Count <hi>Mansfield,</hi> and the reſt of the regall Senate never wont to be abſent, <hi>Mondragonius, Billius, Olivera,</hi> and <hi>Pacius,</hi> all Spaniards of <hi>Belgians,</hi> there were <hi>Mottaevs, Goigne,</hi> and <hi>Licquius,</hi> for the reſt of the Low-country men were abſent: of others, there were <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus à Monte, George Baſta,</hi> and <hi>Camillus Capiſuccus.</hi> Moſt of theſe <note place="margin">Moſt are againſt it.</note> were even amazed with the greatneſſe of the propoſed deſigne, and thought the attempt more bold, then could be brought to a proſperous end. For ſaid they, he who would think of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieging <hi>Antwerp,</hi> ought ſeriouſly to conſider whether hee have ſufficient forces, wherewith at the ſame time, he
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:192040:4"/> may block it up by land in <hi>Brabant,</hi> and by the river on <hi>Flanders</hi> ſide: For it were in vaine to beſiege it by land, to which by the river, if not from above from <hi>Gaunt,</hi> at leaſt from below, to witt, from the Sea, both proviſion and reliefe may continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be brought in. But the river was ſo broad, that it could not be blockt up by leſſe then two armies on either ſide one. Wherefore hee had need of three armies, who from Brabant, and either banke of the river <hi>Scheldt,</hi> might ſtop reliefe. But that would not be done, by reaſon of his ſmall forces. Neither had he ſufficient ſhipps wherewith to hinder the enemies Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie about to enter the river from the ſea. To theſe things added <hi>Billius,</hi> that the complaints of the Souldiers more troubled him, who being defrau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of their pay, not comming from Spaine, almoſt hungerſtarved, and moſt of them halfe naked, verily were unfit to be brought to a ſiege, of more then one moneths continuance. Nor did <hi>Pacius</hi> and <hi>Montius</hi> omit, that it was ſeriouſly to bee thought on, whether it were beſt to begin <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp</hi> ſiege, leaving <hi>Dendermund,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:192040:5"/> Gaunt,</hi> and other holds behind him from whence the enemy with free ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions, might diſturbe the bringing in of proviſion unto the Army, and the raiſing of Fortifications. Laſtly, all except <hi>Mondragonius,</hi> and <hi>Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuccus,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Two only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</note> who committed all to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi> fortune, thought it unſafe and unſeaſonable, to ſet upon ſo great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes with ſo ſmall forces. Therefore turning from the ſiege of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> to <note place="margin">And ſtrive to divert his minde from the ſiege.</note> beſiege <hi>Alexander,</hi> they ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him with joynt prayers: and objecting the danger of loſing both his and their owne honours, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to ſubdue his minde in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution ſtill immoveable. But hee <note place="margin">But his opinion is to beſiege it.</note> commending their care, in the firſt place ſaid that he had reflected on all thoſe things which they conceived to be the greateſt dangers. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he did not thinke, out that after they had heard him reaſon a little on the matter, they would think better of the ſucceſs. Then hee began much after this manner: <q>That hee had not the thought of invading <hi>Antwerp,</hi> before he was encouraged by pious men, that it would be acceptable to God: and had known the Kings
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:192040:5"/> minde concerning it. Neither did he doubt that human and ordinary helps would be wanting, which for the preſent might perſwade the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition. For, he certainly knew, that the enemies were never in like fear, being within few months af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with ſo many and ſo great loſſes by the Kings Army; <hi>viz.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtitute of the Prince of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range's counſells, out of hope of ſuccour from the French, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving loſt ſo many Townes and Caſtles, nere adjoyning to <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp.</hi> And ſurely, when the walls being battered, do tremble and ſhake, then with greater certainty may the aſſault be purſued. And from thence had he greater encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to aſſail the affrighted enemies, even in their chiefeſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe of war, and to carry that ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour through the ſtrong holds of <hi>Brabant:</hi> not with vain hope, that they will for fear of loſing <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp,</hi> either ſlight other places; or, for fear of loſing other places, will not be able to defend it. Indeed he had but few forces to ſet upon ſo many things with; but, they were
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:192040:6"/> skilfull in war, accuſtomed to victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and, which is above all, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by great commanders. For, unto which of your hands here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, might not one ſafely deliver the charge of an Army? FOR, by the skill of Captains, and prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſe of Souldiers, an Army is dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. And be they never ſo many, thoſe be but few who conclude the victory. As of a ſpear, how long ſoever the palm only of the cuſpe doth all the execution. GREAT forces are not alwaies to be wiſhed for in war, no more then great bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, being for the moſt part ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to many infirmities, us'd to be more pamper'd, move flowlier, and are but fairer marks to be le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled at. Nor had he caſt over with himſelfe ſo to win <hi>Antwerp,</hi> that it was needfull to imploy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Souldiers about it; fith that by land, a few troopes of Horſe, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king inroades into the territories of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> between <hi>Liere, Hoch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,</hi> and <hi>Breda,</hi> Townes of the Kings party, might eaſily hinder traffick. And by the River, towards the Ocean (from whence the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:192040:6"/> force of the enemy was to be feared) he had determined, either to take the Caſtles on both ſides the River; or to build new ones; and from thence with Canon ſhot to reſtrain the Ships paſſage, if not all, at leaſt ſo much, as that the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants might perceive their loſſe, and the City, full of Inhabitants might be wearied out for want of proviſion. Nor ſeemed thoſe forces which for the preſent he had with him, unable to perform theſe things: Nor did he doubt of their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the work, having try'd, that his Souldiers were more couragious in battle, then mutinous in their quarters: But, leſt they ſhould be diſcouraged, he had lately received a ſumme of mony from the King, which he would divide amongſt his Veterans; for thoſe that were newly come out of <hi>Spain,</hi> had already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived pay.

                  <note place="margin">The inventour.</note> an admirable Engineer, coming out of <hi>Italy</hi> into <hi>Spaine,</hi> is ſaid a long time to have deſired acceſſe to the King, that he might offer him his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which would be very advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for him in the Low-Countries. But being a long time put off, and at laſt ſleighted; as hee was not brought up at Court to patience, departed thence in a rage, and threatned ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long ſo to effect, that his Majeſty of <hi>Spaine,</hi> ſhould heare of the name of this deſpiſed perſon not without teares. And then went to <hi>Antwerp,</hi> where he got by this occaſion; as I have begun to relate, a fit opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of expreſſing the malice of his gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led mind. He built foure ſhippes with <note place="margin">The ſtructure of foure of them.</note> flat bottomes, and high ſides, both of them much thicker and ſtronger then ordinary: and thus invented to make <note place="margin">Mines made in them.</note> mines in the Waters. Firſt of all, in
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:192040:41"/> the keele of the ſhip, hee made a wall of lime and brick, as it were the floar, or ground-work, one foot high, and five foot broad: and extended it the length of the Ship; then hee erected walls on each ſide the compaſſe of the foundation, three foot high, and as broad, covering them cloſe, being firſt fill'd with Gun-powder tempered by an exqniſite Art, known only to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. The covering was of Grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones, Mill-ſtones, and other huge ſtones. Upon this covering hee made another height Vault-wiſe, of Mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones, and other huge ſtones alſo, which leaning one to another made a ridge, that the ſlaughter might not onely be ſtraight forwards, but on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide; within this higher vault he laid Iron and Marble balls, chaines, blocks, nailes, knives, and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this wicked witty man thought moſt damageable. Laſtly, as farre as lay open between the ſides of the ſhip, and the wall and roof of the mine, he fill'd up with ſquare ſtones cloſe join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and beams faſtened with Iron. But covered, and hid all theſe things with ſtrong planks, and a brick floore, in the middle whereof hee ſet fire to a
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:192040:42"/> pyle of wood, (that the ſhippes might ſeeme to bee ſet out in that order to burne downe the bridge) putting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Wood, pitch and brimſtone, not to bee extinguiſhed, before the mine ſhould be fir'd with the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Timber, hee fram'd two wayes to <note place="margin">Two wayes of firing the mines</note> fire the Mine: In ſome of the ſhippes plac't matches beſmear'd with gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, which being privily extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through part of the keele, were ſtretched into the Mine, of that length, as by a certain meaſure he had before tryed, would continue light, untill the ſhippes ſhould come to the bridge. In other ſhippes, hee uſed thoſe kinde of clockes, which are wont by an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and pleaſant Art, to be exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in ſtead of night-watchers to light lamps. And ſo ordered the ſtratagem, that it ſhould continue with a gentle motion of the wheeles, untill the ſhip arrived at the bridge: and then with a ſudden and violent meeting together of the wheeles, and flint, ſtrike ſome ſparcles, which recived in the bruiſed gun-powder there ſcattered, taking fire, might inflame the train there layd: and this reaching to the mouth of the Mine, might ſpeedily convey
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:192040:42"/> that creeping fire into it. <hi>Jambell</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving finiſhed foure ſhippes after this manner, added to them thirteen leſſer, <note place="margin">To theſe foure greater, are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thirteen leſſer.</note> having within them nothing hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but the Hatches covered with huge fires. Nor was this preparation unſeene of the Royaliſts, although <note place="margin">The Royaliſts in the interim ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous.</note> they were ignorant of the ſtratagem: who imagined the fleet was in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ready in the City, to the intent the bridge might at once be aſſailed on the one ſide by the <hi>Antwerpians,</hi> and on the other by the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Zealanders.</hi> Wherefore his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency ſtrengthening the Caſtles, and Forts with greater guards, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to the bridge the chiefe of his ſouldiers, had a watchfull eye to the enemies deſignes: who by how much hee ſeemed the better prepared to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the ſlaughter, was ſo much neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <note place="margin">

When behold from the City there appeared three ſhippes brightly ſhining with fire, and a little after followed others, and after thoſe others. Then all the noyſe in the Camp was arme arme, and the bridge was filled with ſouldiers. The ſhipps were carried down the river two and three together, in ſo orderly a courſe, as
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:192040:43"/> if they were but to make a ſhew; for they were then governed by Marrl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: and the fire in every ſhip ſhined ſo clearly, that they ſeemed not to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">Their fires made a wonderfull ſhew in the night,</note> fires, but verily to burn themſelves, and ſo fire to ſaile, and bee nouriſhed amongſt the Waters. And truly that night was that Scene acted, which might have been a pleaſant ſpectacle, if the ſpectatours had beene exempt from feare and care. For the banks of the River, and the Caſtles plac't there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhined with continuall fires. The Companies of armed men ranged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long <note place="margin">As alſo the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers along the banks.</note> the banks made a reflection of the ſhining light: the fiery ſhippes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the <hi>Scheldt</hi> hurtleſly ſpitting their flames, it was to bee doubted, whether they came to be a ſport, or (full of deceit) a deſtruction. Then the aſpect and pomp of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Souldiers ſhining in bright Armour, their weapons drawne, and colours diſplai'd all along the bridge, augmented the Pageant. Laſtly, all things compoſed to the uncertaine pleaſure of this new Theater, both ſtruck terrour, and yet were delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: they feared, and yet had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the cauſe of their feare. And
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:192040:43"/> now theſe ſhippes were ſcarcely two miles off the bridge, when the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners <note place="margin">The ſhippes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach neerer;</note> that conducted them, directing their helmes, turned thoſe four ſhipps that were made with Mines ſtraight down the midſt of the channell, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the bridge, not ſo greatly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for the reſt and forthwith ſetting fire to the match leap't into the boats to behold a farre off the ſucceſſe. But they wanting their Pilots, did not at all keep one courſe: moſt of the leſſer <note place="margin">The leſſer ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no ſucceſs.</note> either daſh't themſelves againſt the oppoſite Machines that were fenced with ſharp pykes, or running on ground ſtuck to the banks. But of the foure that carried within them ruine, one leaking was ſwallowed up in the midſt of the River, vomiting onely ſmoake and Thunder. Two others of <note place="margin">Nor three of the greater.</note> the foure towards <hi>Caloo,</hi> (the River being deeper there and running ſwif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) the Wind blowing hard out of <hi>Brabant,</hi> forc't on <hi>Flanders</hi> coaſt, and there grounded them. Nor did the <note place="margin">The fourth is ſtay'd by the floates.</note> fourth ſeeme to have any better for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune being almoſt caſt on <hi>Flanders</hi> coaſt, and violently driven upon the very fartheſt part of the floates.

Yea, they were ſo bold, as from <hi>Flanders</hi> ſide, to board one of thoſe ſhippes that was gravel'd there, and try with javelins what might bee within it. When that ſhipp, which I ſpake of laſt, being greater and ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <note place="margin">But when it broke through the floates,</note> then the reſt, eaſily eſcaped thoſe ſharp pointed Engines, broke downe the oppoſite Machine, and came on fiercely againſt the bridge. Then were the ſouldiers renewing their ſhoutes, againe ſolicitous and fearfull. And <note place="margin">They were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain ſolicitous.</note> Prince <hi>Alexander,</hi> who having his thoughts bent ſeverall wayes, now had regard to the Navy lying at <hi>Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi> then nearer attending to the <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werpians</hi> deſigne, forthwith at thoſe <note place="margin">Alex. <hi>haſtens to divert the ſhipp from the Bridge.</hi>
                  </note> ſhoutes repaired thither, where the fire-ſhip ſeemed to attempt; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ſome Marriners to board the ſhip diſperſe the wood, and quench the fire: others to keep off and prevent the danger with long poles, and pikes. He himſelfe ſtood in the wooden Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:192040:44"/> which is the furtheſt part of the Pile-work from <hi>Flanders</hi> ſide, to which the navall bridge is connected. There were with him <hi>Rubaſius, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jatane, Billius,</hi> and <hi>Vaſtius,</hi> with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chiefe Commanders, beſides the guard of the place.

Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he knew how excellent <hi>Jambell</hi> was in this Art, and perhaps had heard how hee had been treated in <hi>Spaine:</hi> and therefore ſuſpected this device to be ſet forth out of the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe of this incenſed man. Or not by humane reaſoning hee did it, but God, who then had determined <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp</hi> ſhould be taken by ſo couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and pious a Generall, putting it into his mind, came to his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and moſt earneſtly deſired him, that ſeeing now hee had ſufficiently provided what things were neceſſary for the preſent, hee would pleaſe to withdraw himſelfe thence, and not to truſt his life, on which every ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers life, yea, the very Warr it ſelfe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, to ſo perilous a place.

And as ſcarcely entered Saint <hi>Maries</hi> Fort on <hi>Flanders</hi> ſhoare, when the houre of the limited time approaching, on a ſudden the fatall ſhip burſt, with ſuch a horrid craſh, as if the very skies <note place="margin">At the ſame time the fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipp burſt,</note> had rent aſunder, heaven and earth had charged one another, and the whole Machine of the earth it ſelfe had quaked. For the ſtorm of ſtones, chaines, and bullets, being caſt out with Thunder and lightning, there <note place="margin">The wonderfull force of it.</note> followed ſuch a ſlaughter, as no man, but that actually it happened, could have imagined. The Caſtle, on which
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:192040:45"/> the infernall ſhip fell, the pile-work of the bridge next to Saint <hi>Maries</hi> Fort, that part of the navall bridge next the Caſtle ſouldiers, Marriners, Commanders, a great number of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, armour, and armes, all theſe this furious whirle-wind ſwept away to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, toſſed in the ayre, and diſperſt as wind doth leaves of Trees. The <hi>Scheldt</hi> prodigiouſly gaping, was firſt ſeen to diſcover its bottom, then ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling above the banks, was even with the Rampires, and overflowed Saint <hi>Maries</hi> Fort above a foot. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the panting earth extended its force and feare above nine miles. There were found ſtones, and that very great ones as grave ſtones and the like, a mile off the River, ſtruck into the ground, in ſome places foure palmes. But no loſſe or deſtruction was more <note place="margin">The ſlaughter various.</note> miſerable then of men: ſome the hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh violence of the fires, either forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with conſumed, or furiouſly and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably daſh't them together: or ſhot them as it were into the ayre, amongſt ſtones and wood, who ſtraight-wayes were bruiſed falling on the earth, or drowned if lighting in the River. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were ſtifled with the peſtiferous
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:192040:46"/> vapours, not wounded otherwiſe: ſome the ſwelling river long tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with hot ſcalding waters: many were ſlaine in the ſhoure of falling ſtones, and ſome the grave-ſtones both kill'd, and intombed; Yet this dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full infernall fury, omitted not to make ſome ſport in this ſo lamentable a Tragedy. The Viſcount of <hi>Bruxels</hi> was taken, and darted out of his own ſhip by this ſudden Tempeſt, but fell over-thwart another ſhipp plac't a good diſtance off. This devilliſh <note place="margin">The ſeverall chances of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> whirle-wind carried Captaine <hi>Tucci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> heavy arm'd out of Saint <hi>Maries</hi> Fort like light chaffe in the ayre, and caſt him down in the midſt of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, out of which hee being well skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in ſwimming looſing his armour, and protected by the Mother of God, whoſe ayde hee implored with great confidence, eſcaped without any harme. But a young man of Prince <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexanders</hi> life-guard diſpatched a farr greater journey; for ſnatched from the bridge a diſtance from <hi>Flanders</hi> ſide, he was carried over a great part of the river into <hi>Brabant,</hi> being but a little hurt in that ſhoulder which firſt light to the ground; and ſaid, hee
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:192040:46"/> ſeem'd like a bullet ſhot out of a piece of Ordinance, he felt behind him ſuch a violence forcing him forward. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <note place="margin">The judgement of ſome concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Engine.</note> there were ſome of opinion that ſurvived the ſlaughter, that what man ſoever fabricated this execrable Engine, compoſed that direfull plague not of naturall ſtuffe but fetch'c that terrible fire from the infernall furna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of hell: that without doubt hee provoked that Thunder and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by Art magick from the Skies: attracted the peſtiferous vapours from no other place, then the black dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Pluto:</hi> and derived the very waters burning beyond meaſure and cuſtome from the Stygian lake. It is ſo FAMILIAR amongſt men, to judge that whatſoever is beyond their capacity, is alſo above humane pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to effect. <hi>Vaſquius</hi> Sergeant Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor of a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Regiment, writes, <note place="margin">The number of thoſe that were ſlaine.</note> there were eight hundred ſlaine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a great number that were woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and maimed: Nor doth <hi>Tucci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> ſpeak of any fewer, who were both preſent at the ſlaughter; Amongſt whom there fell many brave ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, chiefe Officers and leaders: But the death of <hi>Rubaſius</hi> and <hi>Billius,</hi>

For his military mind there was none more confident, or fortunate: and therefore hee was often by the States confederate, invited to return to their party, for whom hee had once fought againſt the King: In the interim they feared him, as conſcious of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells and ſtrength. The love of Prince <hi>Alexander</hi> heaped theſe dignities up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, which his Excellency knew hee well deſerved, for the returne of <hi>Waloone</hi> Provinces, chiefly by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, to their allegiance: for his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery and preventing the treacheries plotted againſt him: &amp; his incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable care and reverence, continually acknowledging how greatly hee was obliged to the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt adoring the very name of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> though otherwiſe high-minded and haughty.

                  <note place="margin">Being thereby highly praiſed, eſpecially by the King.</note> had greater courage now, in repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bridge, or before in building it.

Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, the <hi>Tirian</hi> ſhip performing its execution with pitch and brimſtone, was not worthy to bee compared to the <hi>Antwerpian,</hi> fighting with fire, ſtinking vapours, ſtones, ſcalding wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:192040:51"/> and ſo with all the Elements at one. And yet for all this great o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow, the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> in one piece of a night repaired the bridge, and conſtantly held on the ſiege till victorious: when <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon</hi> was almoſt in deſpaire, and but that the fortunate arrivall of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy from <hi>Cyprus</hi> ſtayed him, and at laſt was cauſe of his conqueſt, he was in mind to have quit the ſiege.

So this <hi>German</hi> quite changed
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:192040:57"/> the uſe of ſayles: and contrived, that as ſayles fill'd with wind, drive on the Veſſel, ſo his new faſhioned ſayle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fill'd with water, might likewiſe move it on with this advantage, (which chiefly intended) that it would keep a direct courſe, for needs muſt the ſhip ſet forth in the middle of the <hi>Scheldt,</hi> not onely be forced for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with the ſayle extended before it, and filled with the ſtreame, ſo much the more violently, by how much the River runs with greater rapidity in the midſt, eſpecially when the tyde back's into the Ocean, but alſo muſt needs keep it from being driven from the deeper part of the channell, by any croſſe guſt of Wind; for the Wind, which flowing above the waters, is accuſtomed to wreſt the ſhipp aſide from its right courſe, could not have the like force on the under water which fill'd the ſayle, with which, the ſhip beſides the courſe of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and ebbing of the Sea, was drawn on as with oares. Aſſuring himſelfe, that no Machine how ſtrong ſoever, was able to endure this violent onſet, but at the very firſt charge of this battering Ram, would faile. And now four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:192040:58"/> of thoſe other ſhippes I ſpoke of, were ſent downe the midſt of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <note place="margin">The enemies Engines ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach in this order.</note> from <hi>Antwerp</hi> about mid-night: ſix of the greateſt whereof carryed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction privately within them, the reſt openly threatned fire, which were led and guarded by ſeventeene little cock-boats tyde and connected toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

To this intent, that ſcarce viſible, eſpecially in the dead of the night, they might, as lying lower and ſecure from danger of their ſharp beakes ſet upon the floates, plac't be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the bridge: and breaking downe that bar, might open a way for the ſhippes to aſſayl the bridge, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſucceſſe. For after the overthrow received the month before, every night ſome light boats, as ſcouts, by his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies command, traced the <hi>Scheldt,</hi> which an Engliſh Captaine, offering his ſervice to Prince <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:192040:58"/> and ſcattered, were by their conductours convey'd ſome one way, ſome another, whilſt in the interim, the Royaliſts ſpeedily with their grapling hooks catching hold of moſt of the greater ſhippes then deſtitute of the leſſers conduct, drew them to the banks, and there anchored them. Where afterwards, they vented their poyſon without any execution. But having not time to ſurprize all, one of them armed with thoſe ſharp weapons <note place="margin">But one brake through the floats.</note> fell on the piled fortification that ſtood before the bridge, and after they had a while goared one another with mutuall wounds, at length the ſhip cutting in pieces the oppoſite beames, and ſhips-maſts, made a breach in the <note place="margin">And opens the paſſage for the new invented ſhip.</note> Machine it ſelfe alſo ſorely bulked, and torne in pieces by the ſharp points, was forthwith ſwallowed by the River.

Moreover theſe beams and barrels were covered with thick boards pitched, to make a plaine even bottom of the ſhip: the ſides were fenced with impregnable battlements, and thick ranked with Wall-pieces. But upon this ſhipp covered with ſtrong planks, there was raiſed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as it were a Caſtle, built almoſt

In ſtating the conditions he would bury in oblivion the <hi>Antwerpians</hi> Delinquencies, for having waged warr againſt God and their lawfull Soveraigne: and incited others of the Low-countreys, as with an allarme from that ſtrong hold, to defection; but would rather have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his Majeſties clemency, and from thence would moderate the chiefeſt of their conditions.

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:192040:85"/>

Upon which ſubject, becauſe hee had often at other times treated, I thought it beſt to inſert one of the lateſt letters from <hi>Spaine,</hi> concerning this matter, part of which was written with his Majeſties own hand. <q>In every trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or parley with Cities or Caſtles, that come into our hands, let this be your firſt, and laſt regard, that in theſe places, the Catholick religion

But if God by reaſon of our great offences, will have it otherwiſe, I think it better to ſpend all my Kingdomes for his ſake, then for any humane reſpect, to decline from this, if not a lucky, doubtleſſe a pious determination.</q> And truly this firme purpoſe of his Catholick Majeſty was very apparent to be acceptable to God; for on the ſame day theſe were written by the King, which was the ſeventeenth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> on the ſame day the <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werpian</hi> agents at their meeting at <hi>Bevera,</hi> receiving their articles, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up the City.

And uſing gentler remedies, hee ſent the Marqueſſe of <hi>Renthi,</hi> an ancient com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the <hi>Walloones</hi> to <hi>Caloo:</hi> to tell them how much they were decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <note place="margin">Sent to ſhew them their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take:</note> and informe them that the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> had received no more pay then other nations.

And in the morning without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther delay, to try their intentions, he cauſed the aſſigned pay to be offered them.
